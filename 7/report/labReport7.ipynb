    "> The grayscale image has a shape of (1056, 1280), indicating it has only two dimensions (height and width). The color image has a shape of (1056, 1280, 3), indicating it has three dimensions - the first two can be implied as the height and width, and the third dimension represents the number of the color channels (Red, Green, Blue).\n",
