    "## 4. Observations\n",
    "### 4.1 Describe how joystick tilt (X/Y) changed your ship’s movement.\n",
    "> Changing the Joystick Tilt essentially changed the instantaneous velocity of the ship - and changed its position over time.\n",
    "### 4.2 How did adjusting SCALE or TOL affect control and arrival?\n",
    "> Changing the SCALE changed the magnitude of the velocity of the ship - although this let the ship cover more distance quickly, it became harder to navigate to the landing point without increasing the tolerance value.\n",
    "> Adjusting the tolerance value made it easier / harder to navigate to the target position - larger tolerance values allowed for navigating relatively close enough to the target position and a success, however, with smaller tolerance values, you had to navigate much closer to the target coordinates.\n",
    "### 4.3 Did the ship drift when you released the joystick? Why?\n",
    "> Initially, when we had not implemented the deadzone value, it did drift - because when it was fabricated, the joystick module wasn't calibirated with a high precision design. This was not random uncertainty because leaving the Joystick idle always caused it to return to the same nonzero position.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Analysis\n",
    "### 5.1 What is the **starting point** and how is it set?\n",
    "> The starting point is the position where the spaceship originates from before navigating to the target position. It is defined by user input.\n",
    "### 5.2 What is the **target location** and how do you check arrival?\n",
    "> The target location is where the ship is intended to arrive (defined by user input). We check the arrival by always comparing the ship's current position to the target position within the tolerance value, if it is close enough to the target position (within tolerance), then we assume arrival, if not, we keep updating the position as per the user input.\n",
    "### 5.3 Why do we use TOL (tolerance) instead of requiring exact coordinates?\n",
    "> To make the pilot's life **much** easier. Requiring exact coordinates would make it almost impossible to navigate to the target position, especially with a joystick that is not perfectly calibrated. The tolerance value allows for some margin of error, making it feasible to reach the target position without needing to be exact.\n",
    "### 5.4 What would happen if you didn't use scaling and just added the raw joystick values to the position?\n",
    "> It would make the ship move relatively fast and uncontrollably, making it impossible to navigate to the target position on a relatively modest tolerance value. And if the tolerance value was larger, and the target position was very far, then it would be navigating too slow. We need to scale the raw joystick values to make the ship's movement more manageable based on the distance to the target position / other factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "## 6. Bonus\n",
    "- [x] Add a **deadzone** to remove drift when the joystick is released.\n",
    "> Implemented\n",
    "- [x] Use the joystick **button {Z}** as a \"boost\" or \"reset target.\"\n",
    "> Implemented\n",
    "- [x] Experiment with different tolerance values or speeds. Describe how it changed the landing challenge.\n",
