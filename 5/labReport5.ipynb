    "## 4. Analysis\n",
    "### 4.1 Echo Pin Behavior\n",
    "The Echo pin goes HIGH when the ultrasonic pulse is sent and remains HIGH until the reflected pulse returns. The pulse width (duration of the HIGH signal) is proportional to the distance traveled—longer pulse = greater distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.2 Distance Calculation Logic\n",
    "The formula used is: **Distance = (Pulse Duration × Speed of Sound) / 2**\n",
    "\n",
    "We divide by 2 because the ultrasonic pulse travels to the object and back (round-trip), so the actual distance to the object is half the total distance traveled.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.3 Sources of Error\n",
    "1. **Temperature variations**: Sound speed changes with temperature (~343 m/s at 20°C), causing distance miscalculations. Appears as systematic offset in readings.\n",
    "2. **Surface angle/material**: Angled or soft surfaces reflect poorly, causing weak echoes or dropouts. Appears as intermittent invalid readings or large fluctuations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.4 Error Mitigation Ideas\n",
    "- **Hardware**: Add a temperature sensor to adjust speed of sound calculations; use voltage divider on Echo pin for protection.\n",
    "- **Software**: Implement median filtering over multiple readings; reject outliers beyond a threshold; add temperature compensation to distance formula.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.5 Sampling Rate Trade-offs\n",
    "Shorter delays increase data resolution but may cause issues: sensor needs ~60ms between measurements to avoid echo interference; excessive polling increases CPU load and may yield redundant data if object is stationary. Balance needed between responsiveness and reliability.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.6 Extensions\n",
    "- **Speed measurement**: Calculate velocity by taking the derivative of distance over time (Δdistance/Δtime) between consecutive readings.\n",
    "- **Motion detection**: Set a threshold and trigger alerts when distance changes exceed it. Could add an LED or buzzer for visual/audio feedback when motion is detected."
